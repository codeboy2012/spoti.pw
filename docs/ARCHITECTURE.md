The repository is organised around **components** and **one authoritative pipeline**, not
finished IPA blobs.

## The pipeline (PwEvevee/build-system/unified.sh)

1. **clean** — `PwEvevee/build-system/_work/` wiped; no stale output can leak into a build
2. **prepare** — input IPA unzipped; Spotify version read from Info.plist
3. **merge** — component payloads copied into `Payload/Spotify.app/`:
   `spotifyglass.dylib` + `EeveeSpotify.dylib` → `Frameworks/`, Orion +
   EeveeSwiftProtobuf + CydiaSubstrate frameworks, `EeveeSpotify.bundle/`, 142 icon
   PNGs at the app root
4. **resolve** — every shared dependency must exist exactly once; same-name different-bytes
   is a hard failure naming both suppliers (message template in `PwEvevee/dependencies.json`)
5. **inject** — five LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands written into the padding after the load
   commands of the main executable; idempotent; refuses non-zero padding
6. **validate Mach-O** — expected commands present exactly once, no duplicate commands,
   every `@executable_path` dependency exists in the staged app
7. **validate filesystem** — no nested .app, no Watch app, no dev junk, no duplicate
   dylibs/frameworks, critical files present
8. **package** — store-only ZIP, fixed timestamps, stable order → byte-reproducible
9. **manifest** — `dist/build-manifest.json` with versions, SHA-256, sizes, validation flags
10. **tests** — deb format + build tests run as part of every build

## Injection contract (byte-audited)

The injected executable must carry exactly these commands, matching the proven
`com.spotipw_0.22.0.ipa` binary (ncmds 153, sizeofcmds 16680):

```
@executable_path/Frameworks/spotifyglass.dylib
@executable_path/Frameworks/EeveeSwiftProtobuf.framework/EeveeSwiftProtobuf
@executable_path/Frameworks/Orion.framework/Orion
@executable_path/Frameworks/EeveeSpotify.dylib
@executable_path/Frameworks/CydiaSubstrate.framework/CydiaSubstrate
```

A clean 9.1.84 binary has ncmds 148; each injected command adds 1. Slack check: the
input binary has ~131 KB of zero padding after the load commands; each command needs
~72 bytes.

## Eevee resource model (why the icons now show)

From the audit (docs/UNIFICATION-AUDIT.md §3): Eevee's BundleHelper searches
1. `<home>/Library/Application Support/EeveeSpotify.bundle` (jailbreak layout), then
2. `Spotify.app/EeveeSpotify.bundle` (main-bundle fallback).

The working IPA proves fallback 2 is what ships. The earlier "icons missing" build was
missing the 142 icon PNGs at the app root and/or the bundle content — not a different
directory. The resolver now fails the build if either is absent, and supports the
Application Support copy as an optional flag for parity with the jailbreak layout.

## Website architecture

```
website/data/projects.json     hand-authored project facts + GitHub coordinates
        │                      (no versions, ever)
        ▼
update-releases.pl ──► GitHub REST API ──► website/data/releases.json
                                                    │
releases/index.json (make-release.pl) ──────────────┤
                                                    ▼
website-src/layout.html + pages/*.html ──► render-site.pl ──► website/**/index.html
```

- **Static, framework-free, zero dependencies.** Every page is fully rendered at publish
  time, so all release information is present with JavaScript disabled. Deployable to any
  static server; `website/nginx.conf.example` is the reference config.
- **Generated, not hand-written.** `website/` is output. Pages are edited in
  `website-src/`; `[[component:name]]` placeholders pull in generated content. Re-running
  the renderer is idempotent.
- **One source per fact.** Repositories, authors and licenses live once in
  `projects.json`; build versions and checksums come from `releases/index.json`; upstream
  versions, dates, assets and notes come from `releases.json`. No version number is typed
  into a page, and `website-tests.pl` fails the build if one is.
- **Routes** — `/`, `/downloads`, `/releases`, `/projects`, `/projects/{pweevee,spotipw,eeveespotify}`,
  `/credits`, `/development`, `/legal`, `/contact`, plus `404.html`. Canonical URL
  `https://pweevee.skytweak.dpdns.org/`; the alternate path `skytweak.dpdns.org/pweevee`
  must 301 to it (single indexed site).
- **Downloads** resolve to a published release asset and nothing else. The site hosts no
  IPA of its own: PwEevee's download is its own GitHub release asset, and the EeveeSpotify
  IPA variants come from the SideloadLabs AltSource, labelled as such. A button is only
  rendered when the asset exists in the generated data and its URL passes the safe-URL
  check; otherwise the page shows an explanatory state and a GitHub link, never a dead
  button.
- **No token in the browser.** The GitHub API is only ever called server-side by
  `update-releases.pl`. `assets/pweevee.js` reads the generated same-origin JSON and
  nothing else — it sends no credentials and contacts no third party.
- **Untrusted upstream content.** Release notes are HTML-escaped first and only then
  given a fixed, tiny set of block structures (`PwSite::notes_to_html`), so upstream text
  can never introduce markup. Asset URLs are validated to be https on a GitHub host.
- **Degradation** — if `releases.json` is missing the pages render an explanatory state;
  if GitHub was unreachable during the last update the previous known-good release is
  shown with a `stale` badge rather than being dropped.
- **One implementation.** `website-src/` is the only place templates, CSS and JS are
  edited: `layout.html`, `pages/*.html` and `assets/*`. `render-site.pl` renders the pages
  and copies the assets into `website/`, which is build output and is never hand-
  maintained. The only files that exist solely in `website/` are the ones the other build
  scripts generate there: `data/*.json`, `assets/brand/`, the derived icon sizes and the
  social card.
- **Design system** — one stylesheet (`website-src/assets/pweevee.css`): an editorial
  system of flat surfaces, hairline rules and one ink, with the blue sampled from the
  official logo artwork (`#2A3762`, lifted to `#90A0D5` on dark) as a small accent. No
  gradients, no backdrop blur, no glow. Some regions take the dark set whatever the theme
  is — the footer, and one band on the home page — and those are the only places the
  falling-star canvas appears. Motion is disabled wholesale under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, where the star field is removed rather than slowed. No
  third-party CSS, fonts or scripts, which is why the nginx example can ship a strict
  Content-Security-Policy with no `unsafe-inline`.
- **Themes** — two intentional sets, not one inverted. **Dark is the default**: the bare
  `:root` block carries it, so it applies with no media query and no JavaScript.
  `prefers-color-scheme: light` switches to the light set, and `html[data-theme="light"|
  "dark"]` overrides both (an attribute selector outranks `:root`, so no `!important`).
  Components only ever read the semantic tokens — a test fails the build if one reaches
  into `--l-*` or `--d-*` directly.

  The visible control offers **System / Light / Dark**. An explicit choice is stored in
  `localStorage` and applied by `assets/theme.js`, a ~2KB blocking script in `<head>`,
  which is what prevents a flash of the other theme; choosing System clears the key and
  returns to the device preference. It is an external same-origin file rather than an
  inline snippet precisely so the strict CSP still holds. With JavaScript off the control
  is hidden and the theme still follows `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Attribution boundary** — for each upstream project the data model separates the
  upstream authors from PwEevee's own work (`pweevee_work` in `projects.json`), and the
  EeveeSpotify page renders the two in separate sections. Upstream credit is never
  removed; PwEevee's integration, unified packaging, validation and distribution are
  never presented as upstream's.

## Import/reference policy

`docs/spoti.pw-builds/` is a pristine clone (git metadata intact). It is never edited,
never built from, and never pushed to. It exists so the integrated payloads can always
be traced back to the exact upstream tree they came from.
