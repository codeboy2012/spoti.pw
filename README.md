## About

**PwEevee** is an independent integration and distribution project for modified Spotify iOS builds.

PwEevee brings together upstream projects and their components into a unified build workflow rather than creating those projects from scratch.

The project currently combines:

- **SpoTi.pw**
- **EeveeSpotify**
- Their required supporting components and dependencies
- A unified integration and packaging pipeline
- Automated validation and build testing
- A public release and distribution website

The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible, and transparent way to build and distribute a unified Spotify iOS IPA while preserving attribution to the projects and people whose work makes the functionality possible.

PwEevee does **not** claim authorship of SpoTi.pw, EeveeSpotify, Spotify, Apple, or any other upstream software.

## Current Release

### PwEevee v0.22.0-alpha — Read Disc

> ⚠️ **ALPHA RELEASE — KNOWN ISSUES**
>
> This is an experimental release containing known bugs and unfinished features.
> It is not considered production-ready.

**Base:** SpoTi.pw v0.22.0  
**Integrated component:** EeveeSpotify v6.6.8  
**PwEevee release:** v0.22.0-alpha  
**Codename:** Read Disc  
**Status:** Alpha / Known Issues

This is the first unified PwEevee release combining **SpoTi.pw v0.22.0** with **EeveeSpotify v6.6.8**.

The resulting IPA has been tested and is working, but the project still contains known bugs and unfinished functionality.

### Known issues

Known issues include:

- Bugs in certain features
- Possible unexpected behavior
- Installation or signing issues depending on the signing method
- Integration issues that may still be discovered
- **Custom app icons are currently not working**

Custom app icon support is planned for investigation in a future release.

There is currently **no guaranteed release schedule**.

## Why EeveeSpotify Is Integrated

SpoTi.pw has historically provided Spotify modifications including functionality such as **Hide Ads** and **Spoof Premium**.

Those capabilities are not expected to remain available as options in future SpoTi.pw releases.

PwEevee therefore integrates EeveeSpotify into the SpoTi.pw-based build so that the project can continue providing a unified build containing functionality from both upstream projects.

This does not make PwEevee the author of either project.
